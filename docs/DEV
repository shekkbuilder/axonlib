the main parts of the library

4. widgets
?. ?

1. portability

this is a very important aspect.
source code for your plugins should be 100% portable across all platforms that axonlib supports,
and everything should be similar and with the same feature set

2. plugin

currently only a vst-wrapper is in place. it takes care of, and simplifies communication between plugin and host.
same thig here as with the portability, everything sjould be portable across plugin formats.
at a later time, there will be wrappers for other plugin formats, like: ladspa/dssi/lv2 (linux), pd externals, etc..
even standalone applications could be built as a plugin, with a plugin wrapper for binary standalone programs.

3. parameters

4. widgets
