- check the licenses for /extern things,
  are they 100% compatible with the axl license?
  (gpl vs closed-source)

  if something can't be used in closed-source,
  because of gpl or something, warn the lib-users
  that they should not use these.

- copy/paste: license headers back into top of files

- copy/paste: docygen comments from rev.151
  (but some needs to be redone because of changes)

- makedocs_dev
  show things they need to know for extending the library,
  or making their own sub-classes of things like widgets,
  parameters, ...

- makedocs_user
  hide protected things, so they see only the things they need to
  focus on, only what is needed to make a plugin with the library.

- remove 'test' directory.
  only tests used wihle developing there.
  none of them is guaranteed to function as the library evolves

- compileall script that compiles all .cpp files found in a specified
  directory

- examine possibilities for upx (or something else) compression of
  linux shared libraries (.so)

- point out that some of the 'extern' files might use other licenses than
  the axonlib itself, and that projects using them must obey these
  licenses (gpl, ..)

- makefiles?
  would it really help anything, since it's mainly .h files?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
core:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- mac?

- axAtomic
  thread-safe atomic instructions for light-weight mutex alternative.

- deprecate all methods and types from the standard library and other headers:
  "math.h", "string.h", "memory.h", "malloc.h", that are used locally.

- investigate the possibility of system calls localization:
  os dependent exit(), abort(), assert(), time()...etc

- (on a later stage) investigate more into the possibility of excluding the
  standard libraries when linking is possible. may require a lot of work for the
  os dependent code and to make it all portable. how would that work for users?
  ...etc

- solidifying and documenting possible methods for debugging memory problems
  and bugs using operator / function overriding and external tools such
  as valgrind (linux), dr. memory (win32), objdump, ndisasm and addr2line
  (binutils).

- find a way to properly add debug symbols in linux builds
  (for use with addr2line)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
plugin:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- programs/banks

- host info (id, name, specific features)
  for host-dependent things
  (for example, window resizing is handled very different in hosts,
  so we might need to do different things depending on host)

- chunks

- more parameter types, for automatic scaling/transforming
  cubed, squared, ms, hz, db, etc...

- dirty-parameters?
  put needs-to-be-updated parameters in a list,
  read this list in doProcessBlock, sub-divide block into chunks,
  and set parameters inbetween these. (event-manager below)

  and we will can avoid getting any direct parameter changes from
  another thread or something in the middle of out processing() calculations

- event manager (ala voice manager but for all kinds of events)

- find default/specific directory (for data files, etc)
  relative to host or plugin? doesn't really matter,
  as long as it's predictable and 'stable' in all hosts (and standalone)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
gui:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- [delegate to skins?]
  png loading simplification & streamlining
  simplify default bahaviour, keep possibilities for manual low-level control

- fonts
  platform-independent handling of fonts
  fontname, size, type (bold, italic, underscore)
  how to do the 'fontname' on different platforms with different fonts installed,
  and each handling fonts differently...
  one way is like web browsers...
  define a set of std font types to chosse between
  sans,serif,mono,big,...
  [there's an interesting ttf parser and renderer here: http://nothings.org/]

- alpha support
  i think it is already there on windows.. but in the interest of total
  platform independence, it's not activated or ready..
  glx (opengl) for linux? axWindowGL? (+canvas,syrface,..)
  look into xrender and/or composite stuff on linux.

- stretchable bitmaps
  same as alpha support, it's there in bitblt or stretchblt in windows,
  but with xlib there's only basic copying of pixel-rectangles. have to
  look into extensions and stuff... or the glx (opengl) idea..

- axCanvas[Win32/Linux]
  clipping rectangles not working properly (most problematic on win32).
  i think it is happening because when we're returning from a
  container's doPaint, we reset the clipping rectangle.
  we could perhaps have some rect stack that we can push and pop to/from

- the skin stuff needs a bit more work, more polish, more functionality,
  and it needs to be solidified, 'cast in stone'...

- more cursor shape constants. missiong a few on windows
  (window resizing, finger vs hand, ...)
  even better: user-defined cursor shapes

- some issues with window resizing. resizing via window borders and
  via wdgSizer. some rect/variables not in sync?

- don't propagate change if widget/parameter value not changed
  (no repeatedly sending 0's, etc..)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
widgets:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- wdgShape
  very simple, to draw backgrounds, simple borders around things, ...
  fill out space in layouts

- wdgTextList
  a scrollbox with labels. max number of elements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
other:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- axScript
  the basic stuff only, so that it's possible to create some
  program flow, conditionals, external functions, variables, ...
  [almost there...]

-axModular
  same thing, but for modular audio ala reaktor/synthedit
  initially with code (connect, compile, execute), but later adding
  an editor-like thing on top of it (perhaps with "export to .cpp")
