- copy/paste: license headers back into top of files

- copy/paste: docygen comments from rev.151
  (but some needs to be redone because of changes)

- makedocs_dev
  show things they need to know for extending the library,
  or making their own sub-classes of things like widgets,
  parameters, ...

- makedocs_user
  hide protected things, so they see only the things they need to
  focus on, only what is needed to make a plugin with the library.

- remove 'test' directory.
  only tests used wihle developing there.
  none of them is guaranteed to function as the library evolves

----------------------------------------------------------------------
core:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- internal float2string, or similar
  get rid of a few sprintf(buf,"%f",var) calls in there...

- mac?

- axAtomic

- deprecate all methods and types from the standard library and other headers:
  "math.h", "string.h", "memory.h", "malloc.h", that are used locally.  

- provide local alternatives for most methods and types in stdlib.   
  
- investigate the possibility of system calls localization:
  os dependent exit(), abort(), assert(), time()...etc

- (on a later stage) investigate more into the possibility of excluding the
  standard libraries when linking is possible. may require a lot work for the
  os dependent code and to make it all portable. how would that work for users?
  ...etc

- solidifying and documenting possible methods for debugging memory problems
  and bugs using operator / function overriding and external tools such
  as valgrind (linux), dr. memory (win32), objdump, ndisasm and addr2line
  (binutils).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
plugin:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- programs/banks

- host info (id, name, specific features)
  for host-dependent things
  (for example, window resizing is handled very different in hosts,
  so we might need to do different things depending on host)

- chunks

- more parameter types, for automatic scaling/transforming
  cubed, squared, ms, hz, db, etc...

- dirty-parameters?
  put needs-to-be-updated parameters in a list,
  read this list in doProcessBlock, sub-divide block into chunks,
  and set parameters inbetween these. (event-manager below)

  and we will can avoid getting any direct parameter changes from
  another thread or something in the middle of out processing() calculations

- event manager (ala voice manager but for all kinds of events)

- find default/specific directory (for data files, etc)
  relative to host or plugin? doesn't really matter,
  as long as it's predictable and 'stable' in all hosts (and standalone)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
gui:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- png loading simplification & streamlining
  simplify default bahaviour, keep possibilities for manual low-level control

- fonts
  platform-independent handling of fonts
  fontname, size, type (bold, italic, underscore)
  how to do the 'fontname' on different platforms with different fonts installed,
  and each handling fonts differently...
  one way is like web browsers...
  define a set of std font types to chosse between
  sans,serif,mono,big,...

- alpha support
  (glx for linux?)
  i think it is already there on windows.. but in the interest of total
  platform independence, it's not activated or ready..

- stretchable bitmaps
  same as alpha support, it's there in bitblt or stretchblt in windows,
  but with xlib there's only basic copying of pixel-rectangles. have to
  look into extensions and stuff... or the glx (opengl) idea..

- axCanvas[Win32/Linux]
  clipping rectangles not working properly (most problematic on win32).
  i think it is happening because when we're returning from a
  container's doPaint, we reset the clipping rectangle.
  we could perhaps have some rect stack that we can push and pop to/from

- the skin stuff needs a bit more work, more polish, more functionality,
  and it needs to be solidified, 'cast in stone',

- mouse cursor is not set correctly in non-client areas of windows
  in win7 (standalone)

- cursor shape constants

- some issues with window resizing. resizing via window borders and
  via wdgSizer. some rect/variables not in sync?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
widgets:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- wdgShape
  very simple, to draw backgrounds, simple borders around things, ...
  fill out space in layouts

- wdgTextList
  a scrollbox with labels. max number of elements.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
other:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- axScript
  the basic stuff only, so that it's possible to create some
  program flow, conditionals, external functions, variables, ...
  [almost there...]
