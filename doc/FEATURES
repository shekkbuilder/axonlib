[in progress, sketch]

* compile to windows or linux, plugin or standalone executable, with no sourcecode changes
• common look, feel, functionality among platforms
• simple to get started, few external dependencies
• no bloat, tiny and compact binaries, no big external libraries needed
• cpu efficient, code prepared for (hopefully) compiler analysis and optimization
• plugin format abstraction (currently vst plugin and standalone exe)
• simplified handling of parameters, tempo, audio, midi, editor, ...
• lots of included example plugins
• hierarchial gui, skinnable, auto-layout, sizeable, moveable, ...
• mouse cursor shapes, hovering hints
• includes a basic, but flexible set of widgets/containers
• simple to make custom widgets
• resizeable plugin window/editor (in selected hosts)
• low level gfx (gdi/xlib) canvas, surface, bitmap, ...
• png-decoding from memory with (include png directly in exe/plugin)
• scripts, stack-based, 4th inspired, rudimentary compilation (bytecode)
• modular audio graph, with connectable dsp modules
• polyphonic voice manager, event scheduler
• heavily optimized math functions and approximations..
• mersenne twister implementation, customized for small binary size impact
• builtin, fast memory allocator routines
• builtin routines for string and memory manipulation
• everything (almost) is optional (no bloat...)
• [plus a lot of forgotten things, and all the small details...]
